							We put more trust in our healthcare providers than almost anyone else, and expect them to understand us and our medical issues. The medical records that providers use are outdated, ignore the way people work and don't help providers and patients address issues. How can they be improved?

								Despite being the first page every user of Kareo sees when opening a patient's record, the facesheet is not a useful tool in the majority of use cases. It attempts to be a summary of the patient's data, but doesn't give any structure or further action to take on that data. At the start of this project, I wanted to get a better understanding of what Kareo's users would want this page to do for them. Based on interviews, observations and literature reviews, I examined the opportunities on both a macro and micro scale.

								On the macro scale, the medical world is undergoing a transformation from being built on doctor to patient visits at a physical clinic to collaborative goal setting and tracking, most of which won't be done at a clinic. In addition to the industry trends, the individual users of Electronic Medical Records are frustrated by endless clicks to different screens, charts of data without a clear use, and a general ignorance of how they work.

								My First sketches were focused on the data entry that happens before a provider sees and diagnoses a patient, things like height, weight and medical history. The goal was to simply make this data entry workflow as streamlined as possible, so that the visit wouldn't lose too much time to data entry.

								My assumption was that people worked something like the sketch below, with a nurse entering a slew of data that simply waited in the facesheet for the provider to decide what was important enough to include in the visit note.

								After doing tests, interviews and further research, I found that my assumption was wrong, and that the majority of customers did almost all of their data entry in the visit note for that day.

							<p class="intro mtm">
								I found that my design wasn't addressing a true need, and had to dig deeper into the way medical providers treat their patients and the information they need to support them.

								Since customers weren't using the facesheet for data entry like I thought, I now had to figure out what purpose the facesheet should serve. The new point of view on the facesheet was that it should serve as the home base for each member involved in a patient's care. 
								<p class="intro">
									Instead of just presenting all the data that has ever been created for a patient, the facesheet should serve as an at a glance indicator of what's wrong with a patient and the plan to resolve their issues.

							<p class="bodytext mtm">
								Providers are almost universally short on time in visits, and constantly have to collaborate with patients to address the most critical issues. The facesheet should be the place where they can quickly see what's going on with a patient, what the plan is to address the issues, and how the plan is working.
